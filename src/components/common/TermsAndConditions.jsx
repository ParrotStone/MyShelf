            - By using the web app, these terms will automatically apply to you
            – you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before
            using the web app. You’re not allowed to copy, or modify the web
            app, any part of the web app, or our trademarks in any way. You’re
            not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the web app, or
            make derivative versions. The web app itself, and all the trade
            marks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual property
            rights related to it, still belong to <strong>MyShelf Inc</strong>.

          <p>
            - <strong>MyShelf Inc</strong>. is committed to ensuring that the
            web app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we
            reserve the right to make changes to the web app or to charge for
            its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never charge
            you for the web app or its services without making it very clear to
            you exactly what you’re paying for.
          </p>
          <br /> <br />
          <p>
            - The MyShelf web app stores and processes personal data that you
            have provided to us, in order to provide our Services. It’s your
            responsibility to keep your devices and access to the web app
            secure. We therefore recommend that you do not use the web app on
            unsecure networks, or from suspicious devices as it could make your
            device vulnerable to different types of attacks and compromise your
            device’s security and could mean that your data will be stolen.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            - The web app does use third party services that declare their own
            Terms and Conditions. You can read their respective Terms and
            Conditions at their respective apps.
          </p>
          <br /> <br />
          <p>
            - You should be aware that there are certain things that{' '}
            <strong>MyShelf Inc</strong>. will not take responsibility for.
            Certain functions of the web app will require the web app to have an
            active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided
            by your mobile network provider, but <strong>MyShelf Inc</strong>.
            cannot take responsibility for the web app not working at full
            functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, or if you don’t
            have any of your data allowance left.
          </p>
          <br /> <br />
          <p>
            If you’re using the web app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you
            should remember that your terms of the agreement with your mobile
            network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged
            by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the
            connection while accessing the web app, or other third party
            charges. In using the web app, you’re accepting responsibility for
            any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the web
            app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without
            turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the
            device on which you’re using the web app, please be aware that we
            assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for
            using the web app.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Along the same lines, <strong>MyShelf Inc</strong>. cannot always
            take responsibility for the way you use the web app i.e. You need to
            make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery
            and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service,{' '}
            <strong>MyShelf Inc</strong>. cannot accept responsibility.
          </p>

          <p>
            - With respect to <strong>MyShelf Inc</strong>.’s responsibility for
            your use of the web app, when you’re using the web app, it’s
            important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that
            it is updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties
            to provide information to us so that we can make it available to
            you. MyShelf Inc. accepts no liability for any loss, direct or
            indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this
            functionality of the web app.
